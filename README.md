# Hack-The-Hill-Encryption
A post quantum computing encryption of a live messaging app

# Goal
To use cool mathy encryption in a simple app.
We decided to implement the New Hope Lattice encryption scheme. It participated in the NIST post-quantum encryption project and made it to round 2.
Most of the top contenders in this NIST project use lattice-based encryption schemes. They primarily work

Working code implementing this encryption scheme on txt files can be found in the new-hope-pq-crypto folder.
We made an unsecure messaging app, but was not able to fully integrate the two in a working secure messaging system.
